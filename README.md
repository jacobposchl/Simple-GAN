# Simple GAN Implementation in Python

This project demonstrates a simple implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) in Python using a basic architecture. The GAN is trained to generate synthetic data/images, and the results showcase the evolution of generated outputs as training progresses.

## Features
- Simple GAN architecture: A generator and discriminator implemented from scratch.
- Trains on a basic dataset and outputs generated samples.
- Customizable hyperparameters for learning rate, epochs, etc.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Libraries: TensorFlow, NumPy, Matplotlib (see `requirements.txt` for details)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/GAN-Project.git
   cd GAN-Project
